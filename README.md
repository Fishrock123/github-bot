# Node.js GitHub Bot

What's this?? ATM an experiment to see if a bot could be helpful for the Node.js project, to automate all the things!

## Get it started

It's required to have a [GitHub API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) before starting the bot.

```bash
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=X npm start
```

### Create a GitHub access token

Go to your own profile settings page and [generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). After clicking the **Generate token** button you're presented with the token you should put in `$GITHUB_TOKEN` when starting the bot.
